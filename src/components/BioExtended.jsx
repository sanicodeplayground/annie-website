          As an illustrator
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am Annie, a freelance graphic designer & illustrator based in Winnipeg, Canada. Iâ€™ve had over seven years of agency experience, and have placed my main focus on Illustration work, Branding and Identity projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I watched an endless amount of animations and was always in awe of beautifully illustrated books, which ended up paving my path to becoming a designer and illustrator. When I'm away from my laptop, I am busy being a cat mom, a video gaming nerd and trying to get outside as much as possible, to enjoy the outdoors.
