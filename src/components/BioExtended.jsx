          As an illustrator
        </h3> */}
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Annie, and I am an illustrator currently based in
          Bristol. You can usually find me scribbling away outdoors in
          frequented spots. I also love getting involved with our local flora
          and fauna directly, through both my work as an ornithologist and my
          time spent ringing birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the receipt of my BA degree in Illustration from The
          University of West England, I have been working on getting the
          narratives of both prevailing and endangered species into the world. I
          do so through my art, creating stories and worlds through my
          illustrations which I hope will inspire my readers to learn more about
          the world around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a showcase of my work, both previous and current,
          including my illustrations and children&apos;s book designs. My focus
          is largely around natural history illustration, from both writing and
          designing fictional and non-fictional works. I love working with any
          analogue medium but I&apos; m particularly drawn to watercolour,
          graphite and ink work.
