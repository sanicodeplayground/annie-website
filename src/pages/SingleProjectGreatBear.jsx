      <p>
        Originally an inuit tribe folk tale about the bear god Nanook, this
        story focuses on the relationship between man and bear. Rewritten for a
        contemporary audience, The Great Bear warns against invasive human
        action through the transformative path experienced by one fisherman.
        This tale is one of hope, proving that empathy for the world prevails
        and our actions can be redeemed.
