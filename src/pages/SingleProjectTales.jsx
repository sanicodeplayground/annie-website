      <h1>The Tales from The North</h1>
      <p>
        The Tales from The North is a collection of stories, inspired by the
        creatures that inhabit the North Pole and folk tales from the local
        area.

      <h2>The Fox Fires</h2>
      <p>
        Adapted from a Finnish folk tale about the Northern Lights, The Fox
        Fires is a story about the creation of the aurora borealis and the power
        of kindness. While highlighting the plight of the arctic fox as a
        species, this tale focuses on the importance of empathy for nature and
        the endless rewards to be reaped from it.

      <h2>The Caribou</h2>
      <p>
        Originally sparked by my interest in the intricacies of the Arctic
        ecosystem, this piece explores the nature of caribou. It was further
        fuelled by the lawsuit against the 211-mile Ambler road construction,
        which sits in the middle of an important landmark for caribou migration.
        This visual narrative explores the importance of preserving the
        wilderness that is vital to these keystone species.
